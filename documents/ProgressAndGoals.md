# Progress and Goals


## Progress:

- Created an API server with endpoints following CRUD operations on related data.
- Endpoints:
	- POST `/journals` - Adds a journal entry
	- GET `/journals` - Returns all journal entries
	- DELETE `/journals/delete/{timestamp}` - Deletes a journal entry by timestamp
	- PUT `/journals/{timestamp}` - Updates details of a journal entry
	- 
	-

- Endpoints and data module functions have unit tests to verify correct behavior, document expected behavior, isolate issues, and receive rapid feedback.


## Goals:

- Currently missing unit tests for our data modules will be created to improve coverage.
